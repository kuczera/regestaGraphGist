= B1 Create Graph Database Manually
== B1.1 Nodes
=== Create and Find
With the command "CREATE" you create a node, represented by two brackets: ()
Within the brackets, you assign a variable to the node, e.g. "n" for "node": (n)
Within this command you can now use "n" to refer to the created node. The variable remains valid only until the command is terminated with a semicolon. It is not saved afterwards and can be reassigned again and again.

With the command "RETURN" you can output (display) something. Depending on the result this can be done graphically or in table form.
The node (n) just created with "RETURN n;" or everything created within the command with "RETURN*;". The asterisk stands for all nodes and edges created or found within the command.
The semicolon closes the command.

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (n) RETURN n;
----
*means*: "Create a node, here called n, and show me n."

The "MERGE" command first checks whether a corresponding node already exists; if not, it is created again.

[source,cypher]
----
MERGE (n) RETURN n;
----

*means*: "Check if there are any nodes. If not, create one. Name the node n. Show me n."

== Delete and cut off
To delete a node we use the command DELETE. First we have to find all nodes in the database we want to delete. We do this with the MATCH command.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n) DELETE n
----
*means*: "Find node, hereinafter called n, and delete n."

This only works because our node has no connections (edges) to other nodes yet. To delete a node that is connected in the database, its edges must first be removed with the DETACH command.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n
----
*means*: "Find nodes, hereinafter referred to as n, delete the associated edges and delete n."

By the way, the command "MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n" deletes your entire database, since the command finds, cuts and deletes every node.

But how do you refer to a specific node in a network?

== Types and Properties
So far we cannot yet distinguish our nodes from each other.
To differentiate them, we can first assign them to node types (e.g. person, letter, city...) and provide them with individual properties (e.g. name, date of birth, material, longitude and latitude...)
The node types and properties are not predefined and can be created as required. (Cf.: Data Modeling).

We now extend the creation command we learned above with a node type:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (n:Person) RETURN n;
----
*means*: "Create a person-type node, here called n, and show me n."

== Add Properties to existing nodes or Create with Properties
In properties you can save further information. For nodes that represent persons, it would make sense to create properties such as "Name", "Date of birth" and "Date of death".

There are two ways to add properties: When you create the nodes or afterwards.

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (f:Person {name:'Friedrich'}) RETURN f;
----
*means*: "Create a Person-type node with the property name Friedrich, here called f, and show me f."

Now, if we want to give Friedrich another property, we add it with SET. It is important that we do not close the command with a semicolon as above, as long as we still want to refer to the node using the variable f.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (f:Person {name:'Friedrich'})
SET for date of birth = '1415-09-21
RETURN f;
----
*means*: "Find a Person-type node where the property 'name' contains the value 'Friedrich', the node is called 'f' in the following. For 'f', create the property 'date of birth' with the value '1415-09-21'. Show me f."

== Use Properties for Search
If we want to find Friedrich in our graph database, we search for him by a property (in this case the name):

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (f:Person {name:'Friedrich'}) RETURN f;
----
*means*: "Create a person-type node with the property "name" Friedrich, here called f, and show me f."

It would work the same way with the date of birth.

== Exercise
=== 1 First Delete all existing Nodes and Edges.

=== 2. Now Create the following Nodes:
* A node of type Person with the property Name "Friedrich".
* A node of type Person with the property Name "Serious"
* A node of type Person with the property Name "Cimburgis".
* Display the result.

=== 3. Add the following Dates of Birth:
* Friedrich: 1415-09-21
* Ernst: 1377
* Cimburgis: 1394 or 1397
* Display the result.

== Solutions

=== To 1. First Delete all existing Nodes and Edges:
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n
----

=== To 2. Now Create the following Nodes:
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (f:Person {name:'Friedrich'})
CREATE (e:Person {name:'Ernst'})
CREATE (c:Person {name:'Cymburgis'})
RETURN *;
----

=== To 3. Add the following Dates of Birth

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (f:Person {name:'Friedrich'})
SET f.DateOfBirth = '1415-09-21'

MATCH (e:Person {name:'Ernst'})
SET e.DateOfBirth = '1377'.

MATCH (c:Person {name:'Cymburgis'})
SET c.DateOfBirth = '1394
RETURN *;
----

== B1.2 Edges
=== Create and Find
An edge (connection, relation) between two nodes is represented in Cypher with an arrow: +++-->+++
The edge always has a direction.
Furthermore, the edge type must also be specified. +++-[:CHILD_OF]->+++

Edges, just like nodes, are created with the CREATE or MERGE commands and searched in the database with MATCH.

An edge between two nodes looks like this in Cypher: +++(f)-[:CHILD_OF]->(e)+++

To create an edge, we have to create the corresponding nodes with MERGE or CREATE or call them from the database with MERGE or MATCH. MERGE is always the safest way for small amounts of data.

== Example 1: Child and Parents
[source,cypher]
----
MERGE (f:Person {name:'Friedrich'})
MERGE (c:Person {name:'Cimburgis'})
MERGE (e:Person {name:'Ernst'})

CREATE (f)-[:CHILD_OF]->(c)
CREATE (f)-[:CHILD_OF]->(e)
RETURN *;
----
*means*:
"Find or create  a node of type Person with the property name "Friedrich", hereinafter referred to as f. +
Find or create a node of type Person with the property name "Cimburgis", in the following called c +
Find or create a node of type Person with the property name "Ernst", hereinafter referred to as e. +
Create an edge of the type "child of" from f to c. +
Create an edge of type "child of" from f to e. +
Show me everything that was just found or created."

== Example 2: Married Couple
[source,cypher]
----
MERGE (c:Person {name:'Cimburgis'})
MERGE (e:Person {name:'Ernst'})
CREATE (e)-[:MARRIED_WITH]->(c)
CREATE (c)-[:MARRIED_WITH]->(e)
RETURN *;
----
*means*:
"Find or create a node of type "person", here called c, where the property name is "Cimburgis". +
Find or create a node of type "person", here called e, where the property name is "Ernst". +
Create an edge of type "married to" from e to c. +
Create an edge of type "married to" from c to e. +
Show me everything that was just found or created."

*By the way: Since edges in Cypher always have one direction, but a marriage is based on reciprocity, we create "Married to" edges twice, i.e. once in each direction.

== Exercise
.Now use the MERGE, MATCH, and CREATE commands to create the following edges and, if they do not already exist, the required nodes:
* Eleonore is married to Frederick
* Friedrich is married to Eleonore
* Gwendolyn is a child of Frederick
* Cunegund is a child of Eleonore
* Maximilian is a child of Friedrich
* Maximilian is a child of Cunegond

== Solution

[source,cypher]
----
MERGE (f:Person {name:'Friedrich'})
MERGE (e:Person {name: 'Eleonore'})
MERGE (k:Person {name: 'Gwendolyn')
MERGE (m:Person {name:'Maximilian'})

CREATE (f)-[:MARRIED_WITH]->(e)
CREATE (e)-[:MARRIED_WITH]->(f)

CREATE (k)-[:CHILD_OF]->(f)
CREATE (k)-[:CHILD_OF]->(e)

CREATE (m)-[:CHILD_OF]->(f)
CREATE (m)-[:CHILD_OF]->(e)

RETURN *;
